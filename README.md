# DisasterResponsePipeline
In this project, you'll apply data engineering skills to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.  Project data set contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. We will be creating a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.  This project also include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.
